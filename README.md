# CISC-3140-Lab12
This is a repository for the files for Lab12- Creating a full-stack app using Node.js.
I reviewed several projects and tutorials, 
and I ultimately dedcided on an app that would create and store a database.
This app would utilize html, javascript,css, node.js, json, npm, and other useful technologies. 

First, I created the HTML and CSS pages that outlined how I wanted my app to look.
Then I used live server to check if it looked correct. 
I downloaded Node.js and used an integrated terminal on Visual Studio Code to utilize the npm command
I installed several npm items, like express, cors, dotenv, and mysql. 
Then I created the app.js file which woudld build out the app using express and cors, and print to the console.
I used an .env file to label a port from which I could access my local host. 
I created a fetch item that would connect the javascript event listener with the backend of the app

Unfortunately, I was not able to get any further than this, since an inspection of the page revealed an error.
I searched documentation, but I couldn't figure out where the error was coming from, especially since it was a very straightforward event listener
However, I was able to get console confirmation that the app could launch.
